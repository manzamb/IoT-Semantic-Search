    "description": "That's right, everything runs in parallel, except your code. To understand that, imagine your code is the king, and node is his army of servants.\r\n\r\nThe day starts by one servant waking up the king and asking him if he needs anything. The king gives the servant a list of tasks and goes back to sleep a little longer. The servant now distributes those tasks among his colleagues and they get to work.\r\n\r\nOnce a servant finishes a task, he lines up outside the kings quarter to report. The king lets one servant in at a time, and listens to things he reports. Sometimes the king will give the servant more tasks on the way out.\r\n\r\nLife is good, for the king's servants carry out all of his tasks in parallel, but only report with one result at a time, so the king can focus. *",
