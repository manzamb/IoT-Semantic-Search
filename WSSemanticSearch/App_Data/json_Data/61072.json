Dublin, Ireland\n\nFrom this site you can view the real-time status of the system, including the temperatures of various parts of the system, the status of the pump & the amount of energy being generated in real-time.\n\nAssuming that the energy saved is equal to the amount of energy generated by the system, the capital cost remaining to repay is tracked & displayed. As of Oct '12 the cost of heating by gas is €0.062845per kWh (supplier: FloGas, including VAT & carbon tax, excluding standing charge). \n\nSystem Details - Solar Water System\nThe solar water system consists of 2 panels of 20 tubes each controlled by a RESOL DeltaSol BS pump station. Energy is transferred by means of water (mixed with propylene glycol) circulation into a 200 litre copper cylinder. The system was installed in July '09 & has been running since. Initial installation cost was approx €3300, however this was reduced to €2300 after a €1000 government grant. The system was purchased in Dublin. Note: Measurement only begun in Jul '12, hence capital cost to repay is overestimated at this point.\n\nSystem Details - Performance\nThe system performs relatively well during the summer & requires very little supplemental heating to produce enough hot water to support the moderate needs of 2 adults. During the winter, however, the system is incapable of raising the cylinder water temperature above approx 40ºC & hence supplemental heating is essential.\n\nAs a point of reference about 4200 Joules are required to heat 1 litre of water by 1ºC. Output rates of approx 70,000 joules/min are not uncommon on sunny days in the summer, approximately enough energy to boil 180ml (≈3/4 cup) of water each minute.\n\nSystem Details - Monitor\nThe monitoring system for this solar system is based on a Microchip PICDEM.net 2 board, running on an 8-bit PIC18J97J60 micro-controller. Temperature measurement is achieved using 5 thermistors (AVX part number NJ28NA0103F). This project was based on the demo project provided by Microchip, heavily tailored to it's current role\n\nThe system monitors operation of the pump & calculates the energy transferred to the water cylinder by the following formula:\n\nJoule/min = (Tin - Tout) * flowrate (lt/min) * 1000 * Specific heat capacity\n\nAs the microprocessor is an 8-bit unit floating point number operations are minimised where possible.",
