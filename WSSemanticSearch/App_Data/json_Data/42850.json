    "description": "Compare the energy efficiency between two residential water heaters operating under identical conditions (intake water temperature, hot water demand/load and ambient temperature). Both heaters have the same volume and are rated at 240 volts 60 hertz. Thermostats are set to 123째F (3째F loss in distribution, 120째F at point of delivery).  Feed #0 is the ambient air temperature in Celsius (note the modest fluctuations when the heat pump water heater activates). Feed #2 is the baseline standard electric resistance water heater (found in most North American homes) using between 1,650 to 4,462 watts depending which (top/bottom/both) elements are energized. Feed #3 is the AquaSense: a high performance heat pump water heater requiring only 734 to 884 watts to do the same job. Energy consumption is for one adult. Multiply the number of people in a household to get an estimate of savings. The AquaSense energy usage is around .75 Kw daily while an electric resistance water heater requires 4 to 5 Kw. Heating pattern differs between the two appliances whereas AquaSense runs longer but less frequently (easy on peaks, a benefit for power utilities). Gas, instant tankless and even high-end solar systems with a solar fraction of 75% are no match for AquaSense. There are additional benefits with AquaSense: side ports (tie-in to solar captors/hydronics), air circulation ~ dehumidification, 3 timers (to run off-peak rates), sanitizing heat mode (165째F) and free distilled water (atmospheric from condensate line). AquaSense HPWH is affordable and has a quick payback time. \r\nInteractive charts can be seen at: http://empowermfg.com/aquasense_data.htm \r\nEnjoy!",
